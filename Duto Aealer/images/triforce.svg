  <!-- I don't know if using illustrator to creat this file and then modifying it after is alright for this class but wow does it save time -->
  <!-- It's not that I don't know how an SVG works I just don't want to spend an extra hour on this than is necessary for me -->
  <!-- And if I had bad intentions I would have changed the artboard to 22 - 22 moved the style into each element and not left these messages-->
